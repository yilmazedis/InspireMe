/*

In iOS, cache policy is used to define how a URL request should be cached in the URL cache. The URL cache is a storage area where responses to HTTP or HTTPS requests are stored for later use, so that if the same request is made again, the response can be retrieved from the cache rather than making a new request.

The cache policy can be set for a URL request using the cachePolicy property of the URLRequest class. There are several cache policy options available:

.useProtocolCachePolicy: Use the cache policy specified by the HTTP response's Cache-Control header.

.reloadIgnoringLocalCacheData: Ignore any cached data and always make a new request.

.returnCacheDataElseLoad: Use cached data if available, otherwise make a new request.

.returnCacheDataDontLoad: Use cached data if available, and do not make a new request.

let url = URL(string: "https://www.example.com/api/data")
var request = URLRequest(url: url!)
request.cachePolicy = .returnCacheDataElseLoad // Set the cache policy to use cached data if available, otherwise make a new request

let session = URLSession.shared
let task = session.dataTask(with: request) { (data, response, error) in
    // Handle the response
}

task.resume()
